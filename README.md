On average, the third month has the coldest minimum temperature on Mars, and the eighth month is the warmest.<br>

Atmospheric pressure is, on average, lowest in the sixth month and highest in the ninth.<br>

The distance from peak to peak is roughly 1425-750, or 675 days. A year on Mars appears to be about 675 days from the plot. Internet search confirms that a Mars year is equivalent to 687 earth days.<br>
